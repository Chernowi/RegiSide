Regicide is a cooperative, fantasy-themed card game for 1 to 4 players where players work together to defeat 12 powerful enemies (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) from a standard 52-card deck. It can be played with a standard deck of playing cards or a specially illustrated Regicide deck. The game is known for its challenging gameplay, requiring tactical decisions and careful hand management.

**Objective:**
The goal of Regicide is for all players to cooperatively defeat all 12 Royalty cards (4 Jacks, then 4 Queens, then 4 Kings). If all 12 enemies are defeated, the players win. However, if any player is forced to discard cards to cover an enemy's attack and cannot discard enough value, that player is eliminated, and all players lose. Players also lose if a player is unable to play a card or yield on their turn.

**Components:**
*   A standard 52-card deck of playing cards.
*   Optionally, 2 Joker/Jester cards (number used depends on player count).
*   The official Regicide deck features unique art by Sketchgoblin. There are Red and Teal versions, differing only in card back color.

**Setup:**
1.  **Create the Castle Deck:**
    *   Separate the 12 Royalty cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) from the deck.
    *   Shuffle the 4 Kings and place them face down in a pile.
    *   Shuffle the 4 Queens and place them face down on top of the Kings.
    *   Shuffle the 4 Jacks and place them face down on top of the Queens. This combined stack is the Castle Deck.
    *   Place the Castle Deck in the center of the table and turn the top card (a Jack) face up. This is the first enemy.
2.  **Create the Tavern Deck:**
    *   Shuffle all the remaining numbered cards (Aces, 2 through 10). Aces are also referred to as Animal Companions.
    *   Add Jesters (Jokers) to this deck based on the player count:
        *   1 Player: 0 Jesters (Jesters are set aside for a special solo rule).
        *   2 Players: 0 Jesters.
        *   3 Players: 1 Jester.
        *   4 Players: 2 Jesters.
    *   This forms the Tavern Deck, from which players will draw cards. Place it beside the Castle Deck.
3.  **Deal Cards:**
    *   Deal cards from the Tavern Deck to each player up to their maximum hand size. Hand size also depends on player count:
        *   1 Player: 8 cards.
        *   2 Players: 7 cards.
        *   3 Players: 6 cards.
        *   4 Players: 5 cards.
4.  **Starting Player:**
    *   The player who has most recently "committed regicide" (or by any agreed-upon method) goes first.
5.  **Discard Pile:**
    *   Establish a shared discard pile next to the Tavern Deck.

**Card Values and Powers:**

*   **Numbered Cards (2-10):**
    *   **Attack Value:** The face value of the card (e.g., a 7 deals 7 damage).
    *   **Discard Value (for taking damage):** The face value of the card.
*   **Aces (Animal Companions):**
    *   **Attack Value:** 1.
    *   **Discard Value:** 1.
    *   **Special Ability:** Can be played with another single card (not a combo of multiple cards of the same rank, and not a Jester). When played with another card, the attack values are summed, and *both* suit powers activate.
*   **Royalty Cards (Jacks, Queens, Kings) in Player Hands (if acquired):**
    *   These cards can enter player hands if defeated with exact damage.
    *   **Attack Value:** Jack = 10, Queen = 15, King = 20.
    *   **Discard Value:** Jack = 10, Queen = 15, King = 20.
    *   Their suit power applies as normal when played.
*   **Jesters (Jokers):**
    *   **Attack Value:** 0.
    *   **Discard Value:** 0.
    *   **Special Ability:** When played, the Jester cancels the current enemy's immunity to its own suit for the remainder of the fight against that specific enemy. After playing a Jester, the current player skips dealing damage (Step 3) and suffering damage (Step 4). Instead, the player who played the Jester chooses *any* player (including themselves) to take the next turn. Communication rules are temporarily relaxed (see Communication section).

**Enemy Stats:**
*   **Jacks:** 20 Health, 10 Attack.
*   **Queens:** 30 Health, 15 Attack.
*   **Kings:** 40 Health, 20 Attack.

**Enemy Immunity:**
*   Each enemy Royal is immune to the suit power of cards that match its own suit. For example, if the Jack of Diamonds is the current enemy, playing a Diamond card will still deal its numerical damage, but the Diamond suit power (drawing cards) will not activate.
*   Jesters can negate this immunity. If a Jester is played against an enemy, suit powers of the enemy's suit will activate for cards played *after* the Jester. For Spades, if Spades were played *before* the Jester against a Spade enemy, their shield effect will begin once the Jester is played. However, for Clubs, Clubs played *before* a Jester against a Club enemy will *not* retroactively gain double damage.

**Gameplay - Player's Turn:**
A player's turn consists of four steps, performed in order:

**Step 1: Play a Card or Yield**
The player must do one of the following:
*   **Play a Single Card:** Play one card from your hand to the table. The card's number is its attack value.
*   **Play a Combo of Cards (Optional Rule/Variant some sources mention):** Some interpretations allow playing multiple cards of the *same rank* as long as their total value does not exceed 10 (e.g., two 4s for 8 attack, or three 2s for 6 attack). If playing with this rule, all suit powers of the played cards would activate. Aces cannot be part of these combos.
*   **Play an Ace with another Card:** Play an Ace (Animal Companion) along with one other non-Jester card. Sum their attack values. Both suit powers activate.
*   **Play a Jester:** Play a Jester. It has 0 attack.
*   **Yield:** The player chooses not to play a card. They say "Yield" and proceed directly to Step 4 (Suffer Damage from the Enemy), skipping Steps 2 and 3.
    *   A player cannot yield if all other players yielded on their immediately preceding turns. For example, in a 3-player game, if Player A yields, then Player B yields, Player C *cannot* yield and must play a card.

**Step 2: Activate Suit Power**
The suit of the card(s) played determines a special power that *must* be activated (unless negated by enemy immunity).
*   **Hearts (♥): Heal from Discard.** Shuffle the discard pile. Count out a number of cards face down from the discard pile equal to the attack value played (e.g., a 7♥ heals 7 cards). Place these cards on the bottom of the Tavern Deck without looking at them. Return the rest of the discard pile face up.
*   **Diamonds (♦): Draw Cards.** Starting with the current player and proceeding clockwise, players draw one card at a time from the Tavern Deck until a total number of cards equal to the attack value played have been drawn.
    *   Players who are already at their maximum hand size are skipped.
    *   Players may never draw cards over their maximum hand size.
    *   There is no penalty for an empty Tavern Deck; players simply draw as many as possible.
*   **Clubs (♣): Double Damage.** During Step 3 (Deal Damage), the damage dealt by Club cards is doubled. (e.g., an 8♣ deals 16 damage).
*   **Spades (♠): Shield against Enemy Attack.** During Step 4 (Suffer Damage), the current enemy's attack value is reduced by the attack value of the Spade card(s) played. This effect is cumulative for all Spades played against the current enemy by any player and remains in effect until that enemy is defeated.

If a Jester was played in Step 1, skip Steps 2, 3, and 4. The player who played the Jester chooses the next player.

**Step 3: Deal Damage to the Enemy and Check for Defeat**
*   Deal damage to the current enemy equal to the total attack value of the card(s) played (doubled if Clubs were played and not immune).
*   Keep track of the total damage dealt to the current enemy by all players.
*   **If the total damage dealt is equal to or greater than the enemy's Health:** The enemy is defeated.
    *   Place all cards played by players against this enemy into the discard pile.
    *   **Exact Damage Bonus:** If the damage dealt was *exactly* equal to the enemy's remaining health, place the defeated enemy card face down on *top* of the Tavern Deck (it will be drawn by a player later).
    *   Otherwise (if damage was greater than remaining health), place the defeated enemy card into the discard pile.
    *   Reveal the next card from the Castle Deck. This is the new enemy.
    *   The player who defeated the enemy *skips Step 4* and immediately begins a new turn (starting from Step 1) against the newly revealed enemy.

**Step 4: Suffer Damage from the Enemy**
*   This step occurs if the enemy was *not* defeated in Step 3, or if the player chose to Yield in Step 1.
*   The current enemy attacks the current player. The enemy's attack value (J=10, Q=15, K=20) is the amount of damage the player must suffer. This damage is reduced by any active Spade shield effects.
*   The current player must discard cards from their hand, one at a time face up to the discard pile, until the total value of the discarded cards is at least equal to the enemy's (potentially reduced) attack value.
    *   Aces count as 1, numbered cards as their face value, and Royalty cards (if in hand) as J=10, Q=15, K=20 when discarded for damage. Jesters count as 0.
    *   It's okay to have an empty hand after suffering damage.
    *   **Player Elimination/Loss Condition:** If a player cannot discard enough cards to satisfy the full damage amount, that player is eliminated, and all players lose the game immediately.
*   After the player has suffered damage, the turn passes to the next player in clockwise order, who starts their turn from Step 1.

**Communication Rules:**
*   Players **may not** communicate any information that reveals or suggests the contents of their hand (e.g., "I have a high Club," or "I wish someone would play a Diamond").
*   Players **may** remind others of public information (e.g., "I only have two cards left," or "The Tavern Deck is almost empty").
*   **Jester Exception:** After a Jester is played, and only for the purpose of choosing the next player, players *may* express a general desire (or reluctance) to go next (e.g., "I have a good play," or "I'd rather not go next"). They still cannot reveal their hand contents.

**Winning the Game:**
Players win immediately if they successfully defeat the last King from the Castle Deck.

**Losing the Game:**
Players lose if:
1.  Any player cannot satisfy the damage dealt by an enemy.
2.  Any player is unable to play a card or yield on their turn (usually because their hand is empty at the start of their turn and they cannot draw cards).

**Solo Play Rules:**
*   Setup as usual for one player (8-card hand size).
*   Instead of shuffling Jesters into the Tavern Deck, place both Jesters to the side, face up.
*   Play proceeds as normal.
*   **Jester Power (Solo):** At the start of your turn (before playing a card or yielding) OR at the start of Step 4 (before taking damage), you may choose to flip one of the set-aside Jesters face down. If you do, you must discard your entire hand and then draw back up to your maximum hand size (8 cards).
    *   This does *not* count as drawing cards for the purpose of enemy Diamond immunity.
    *   Flipping a Jester in this way does *not* cancel the enemy's suit immunity.
    *   This can be done twice per game (once for each Jester).
*   **Victory Conditions (Solo):**
    *   Win using 0 Jesters: Gold Victory.
    *   Win using 1 Jester: Silver Victory.
    *   Win using 2 Jesters: Bronze Victory.

**Optional/Clarified Rules & Notes:**
*   **Animal Companions (Aces) with Combos:** An Ace can be played with a single card, not with a pre-existing combo of multiple same-ranked cards.
*   **Mulligan (Variant):** One source mentions a mulligan if a player starts with no Diamonds. This is not in the primary rules.
*   **Companion App:** A free "Regicide Companion" app is available to help track enemy health and attack, which can be useful.
